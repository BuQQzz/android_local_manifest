Getting Started
---------------

To get started with please see our [wiki](https://github.com/KFire-Android/android_local_manifest/wiki).

Make a build directory:

	mkdir Andoid (or whatever name you choose)
	cd Android (or the name  you chose)
	

To initialize your local repository using the AOSP manifest, use commands like these:

    repo init -u https://android.googlesource.com/platform/manifest -b android-4.1.1_r1
    
    curl -L -o .repo/local_manifest.xml -O -L https://raw.github.com/KFire-Android/android_local_manifest/jb-aosp/local_manifest.xml

    	( or Download: https://github.com/KFire-Android/android_local_manifest/blob/jb-aosp/local_manifest.xml
		and place it in ~/Android/.repo/local_manifest.xml (or ~/'name you chose'/.repo)

Then to sync up:

    repo sync

Apply the following patches (these are subject to change)

	mkdir patches
	curl -L -o patches/patch_build_fix-errors-and-assert.patch -O -L https://raw.github.com/KFire-Android/android_local_manifest/jb-aosp/patch_build_fix-errors-and-assert.patch
	curl -L -o patches/patch_frameworks-base_fix-rotation.patch https://raw.github.com/KFire-Android/android_local_manifest/5832dee3f6ce085e4fb9ab2ea80591c30312a039/patch_frameworks-base_fix-rotation.patch
	curl -L -o patches/patch_hardware-ti-omap4xxx_fix-camera.patch https://raw.github.com/KFire-Android/android_local_manifest/5832dee3f6ce085e4fb9ab2ea80591c30312a039/patch_hardware-ti-omap4xxx_fix-camera.patch
	cd build
	git apply ../patches/patch_build_fix-errors-and-assert.patch
	cd ../../frameworks/base
	git apply ../../patches/patch_frameworks-base_fix-rotation.patch
	cd ../../hardware/ti/omap4xxx
	git apply ../../../patches/patch_hardware-ti-omap4xxx_fix-camera.patch
	cd ../../..

    . build/envsetup.sh
    lunch full_otter-userdebug
    make otapackage (can add -j# for cores to use: make -j32 otapackage)
